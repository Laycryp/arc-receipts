Arc Receipts is a simple on-chain receipts dApp for Arc testnet.
It lets you:
- Send USDC payments with structured metadata (category, note, token route).
- Get a shareable, verifiable receipt page with direct ArcScan tx link.
- Keep a private history filtered by “sent” / “received” for your wallet.

Planned: turn each receipt into an NFT for long-term, non-editable proof of payment.
